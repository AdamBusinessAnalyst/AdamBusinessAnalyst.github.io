## Featured Projects

### [Vinted Visibility in AI Search (SQL & AEO Strategy)](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Vinted-Visibility-Analysis)

* **Goal:** Analyze Vinted's "Share of Model" in AI search results (ChatGPT) compared to competitors like eBay and Depop.
* **Tech:** SQL (Complex Joins, CASE statements, Aggregations), Data Modeling.
* **Outcome:** Discovered Vinted dominates 75% of "budget" queries (<€20) but loses significant visibility on specific brand searches due to unstructured listing titles.

### [SkyTab POS Support Analysis (Python & SQL)](https://github.com/AdamBusinessAnalyst/POS-Support-Call-Driver-Analysis)
* **Goal:** Analyze support ticket data to distinguish between "Hardware" (connectivity) vs. "Operational" (menu config) friction points.
* **Tech:** Python (Pandas for cleaning), SQL (for volume aggregation).
* **Outcome:** Quantified that printer connectivity issues take **3x longer** to resolve than menu updates, validating the need for a specialized hardware support tier.
