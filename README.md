## Featured Projects

### [SkyTab POS Support Analysis (Python & SQL)](https://github.com/AdamBusinessAnalyst/POS-Support-Call-Driver-Analysis)
* **Goal:** Analyze support ticket data to distinguish between "Hardware" (connectivity) vs. "Operational" (menu config) friction points.
* **Tech:** Python (Pandas for cleaning), SQL (for volume aggregation).
* **Outcome:** Quantified that printer connectivity issues take **3x longer** to resolve than menu updates, validating the need for a specialized hardware support tier.
